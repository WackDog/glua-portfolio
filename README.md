## 👋 About Me

I got my start with Lua through Don’t Starve modding, building custom characters and playing with game mechanics. That hobby quickly turned into a deeper interest in game scripting, which now has eventually led me into Garry's Mod development — where I’ve began spending time building clean, modular systems using GLua.

Outside of GMod, I work as a Software Engineer Intern, with over 7 years of experience across C, JavaScript, and Java. I bring professional software practices into my game dev work: structure, reusability, and safe, efficient code.

I’m comfortable working independently or in teams, with experience in:

- Git workflows (branches, commits, pull requests)
- Organized codebases with consistent structure
- Team debugging and reviews
- Iterative, test-based development

### 📌 Project Review Note

I'm always happy to walk through the reasoning behind my implementations — whether it's networking choices, UI design, or overall structure. If you're reviewing any of the projects above and have questions, I'm more than happy to explain my decisions or talk through possible improvements.

## 📁 Additional Work

More projects are on the way as I move code over from Replit and other private spaces. This includes:

- Utility systems and quality-of-life mods  
- AI scripting experiments  
- Discord bot projects  
- Miscellaneous GLua experiments and tools

## 🧩 How I Work

When it comes to development, I care about:

- Writing modular, easy-to-read code  
- Keeping client/server logic separated properly  
- Designing systems that are scalable and maintainable
- Clean commit history and structured repos  

I enjoy both building systems from scratch and improving existing ones — whether solo or working alongside other devs.
